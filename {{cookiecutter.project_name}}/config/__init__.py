"""Maintain the configurations used by Hydra.

Hydra is a package that maintains the configuraiton settings of projects.
The official documentaiton does not show that an __init__.py file required
but the author in a recent blog (I don√®t have the url) says that it is 
required for some functions. I noticed Hydra is about three times faster
when there is an __init__.py file.
